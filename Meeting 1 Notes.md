#Meeting 1 Notes – September 7th, 2016#

##Problem Space and features
* There are a lot of competing finance management systems that have bad design.
* Bad UI is common
* Quicken Route - analyze the financial statistics after the fact or do budgeting.
* Tagging and graphs.
* Structure: Accounts -> transactions -> (credit, debit) -> tags
* Add management aspect
* Import transactions in bulk or individually, manual additions too
* Ensure no duplicate charges, etc.
* Monthly Bills - Set amounts, vendors
* Encrypted on-disk and in-memory

##UI features
*Left hand side is a date, then payee tags, right hand side (credit or debit) and ending balance.
* Stretch goal/gold plating will be the reordering/hide/show row functionality

##Other notes
* YNAB is good with budgeting but is forcing budgeting. Let people look after the fact. 
* Deliverables each quarter
* Sprints with burn down rates
* Talk with Sean about feature priority
* Need a cool name and graphic

##Technologies
* Open Source - Github
* Java - logic/backend
