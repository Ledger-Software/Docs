#Features
This document contains an up-to-date list of our application's available features.

##Import Financial Transaction Records From External Sources
The application allows the user to import transactions from external files. These files can be downloaded from almost all bank websites. Currently, we support two file formats: a Chase Bank CSV and Quicken's older QFX format, which is used by most banking institutions. This feature automatically detects potential duplicate transactions and notifies the user.

##Manually Add Transaction Records
Users can manually insert individual transactions by providing the application with all the required information.

##On-Disk Encryption
All data stored on-disk is encrypted using the AES encryption specification.

##Track Financial Accounts
Users can add financial accounts and associate transactions with those accounts to track the state of those accounts.

##Ability to Modify and Delete Existing Transactions
Users can easily modify and delete any existing transactions.
